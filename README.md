#Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)

This repository contains the code base of the [Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)](http://www.eclipse.org/gef/) project's legacy components [Draw2d 3.x](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/draw2d/index.php), [GEF (MVC) 3.x](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/gef_mvc/index.php), and [Zest 1.x](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/zest/index.php), which are still maintained but will not be developed further. The code base of the current GEF production components is located in the [eclipse/gef](https://github.com/eclipse/gef) repository instead.

### Where to find Documentation?
Reference documentation, tutorials, and examples are provided in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/eclipse/gef-legacy/wiki).

### Where to ask Questions?
While the [GEF forum](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=81) is the primary place to ask questions, announcements and team discussions take place over the project's ['dev' mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/gef-dev). 
Subscription is open to everybody, and as it is the primary communication channel between the project team and the community, it is highly recommended to subscribe.
